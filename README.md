## What I Used

- React
- Typescript
- Github Pages

## Notes

- I'm putting my source code into a branch called `source`. Github pages then builds my website in the `main` branch

This repo will also act as my submission for all WEB class assignments.
My name is Samriddhi Lamichhane. A fun fact about me is that I have the highest spice tolerance in my entire friend group.

## Deployment Instructions

1. _make changes to source code_
2. `git add .`
3. `git commit -m "commit_message"`
4. `git push origin source`
5. `npm run deploy`
